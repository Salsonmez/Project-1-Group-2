# Remote Work Impact on Commercial Real Estate and Transportation

## Hypothesis

The shift towards remote work is significantly changing the commercial real estate and transportation markets in major U.S. cities by accelerating the decline of the use of traditional office buildings and need for daily commuting.

1. **Remote work could mean vacant office spaces:** As more people work from home, companies will need less office space. With vacancies on the rise, landlords could be forced to lower rent to attract tenants.

2. **Individual cities and varying outcomes:** The impact of remote work may vary widely depending on each city's economy, transportation, and real estate market.

## To evaluate our hypothesis, we will look at:

### 1. The Shift to Remote Work

- **Changing commute patterns:** We will analyze U.S. Census data to see if people are commuting less often or for shorter distances, which could signal an increase in remote work.

- **Declining public transit use:** We will examine Federal Transit Administration data to determine if fewer people are relying on public transportation, another potential indicator of remote work adoption.

### 2. Commercial Real Estate Trends

- **Office vacancies and pricing:** We collected data from CBRE, JLL, and CoStar on office vacancy rates and prices in twenty-five major U.S. cities from 2015 to 2024. These cities include:

  - Boston
  - Dallas
  - Miami
  - Atlanta
  - Tampa
  - Detroit
  - Philadelphia
  - Chicago
  - Manhattan
  - New Jersey
  - Austin
  - Denver
  - Orlando
  - Phoenix
  - Bay Area
  - Nashville
  - Charlotte
  - Washington DC
  - Houston
  - Los Angeles
  - Portland
  - Seattle
  - San Francisco
  - San Diego

- **Digging deeper:** We will analyze the data carefully to understand how strong the relationship is between remote work and commercial real estate. We will consider other factors like local economies, the rise of remote work since the Coronavirus pandemic, and commercial real estate.

- **The big picture:** What other things could influence our results? Things like population changes, the number of office buildings, the pandemic, and overall economic conditions.

### 3. Drawing Conclusions

- **In Summary:** Our findings will show whether remote work is affecting office vacancies and prices, is impacting and highlight key trends and differences between cities.

By studying these trends, we hope to better understand how remote work is reshaping the commercial real estate world.
